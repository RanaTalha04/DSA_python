# DSA Python

## Overview

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms** implementations in **Python**. You use it to practice core DSA concepts, prepare for interviews, and strengthen problem solving skills with clean, readable code.

## Goals

* Build strong fundamentals in data structures
* Practice common algorithmic patterns
* Improve time and space complexity analysis
* Prepare for coding interviews and exams

## Contents

<!-- * **Arrays and Strings** -->
* **Linked Lists**
<!-- * **Stacks and Queues**
* **Hashing**
* **Trees and Binary Search Trees**
* **Heaps and Priority Queues**
* **Graphs**
* **Recursion and Backtracking**
* **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
* **Basic Dynamic Programming** -->

## Project Structure

Each topic has its own folder. Each folder contains Python files with focused implementations. File names clearly reflect the concept or problem.

## How to Use

* Clone the repository
* Open it in VS Code or any code editor
* Run files using **Python 3**
* Read the code to understand the logic
* Modify solutions and add your own implementations

## Who This Is For

* Computer Science students
* Beginners learning DSA with Python
* Anyone preparing for technical interviews

## Requirements

* Python **3.8+**
* Basic understanding of Python

## Contributions

You can contribute by adding new problems, improving existing solutions, or optimizing code. Keep solutions simple, efficient, and readable.
